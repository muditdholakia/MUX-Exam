			<h3><b>Pattern of Question Papers : Total 65 Questions (ALL Objective Type) Total Marks : 100	Each question has ONLY one correct answer. Answer sheet: OMR (ONLY Black Ink Ball Point Pen is allowed to darken the appropriate bubble)</b></h3><br />
            <p>GATE 2014 Examination will be ONLINE for Chemical Engineering & Civil Engineering.</p>
            <p>GATE 2014 Examination will be OFFLINE for Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Communication, Instrumentation Engineering, Computer Science & IT and Mechanical Engineering.</p>
            
            <h3><b>GATE 2014-15 would contain questions of four different types in engineering papers: : </b></h3><br />
            <ul class="style2" type="square">
            <li class="first">Multiple choice questions carrying 1 or 2 marks each.</li>
            <li class="first">Common data questions, where two successive questions use the same set of input data.</li>
            <li class="first">Linked answer questions, where the answer to the first question of the pair is required in order to answer its successor.</li>
            <li class="first">Numerical answer questions, where the answer is a number, to be entered by the candidate using the mouse and a virtual keypad that will be provided on the screen.</li>
            </ul><br />
            <h3><b>Note :</b></h3><p> Sectional cut-off  ( Technical / Non-Technical like Engineering mathematics & General Aptitude ) are not applied in GATE exam.
In all the papers, there will be a total of 65 questions carrying 100 marks, out of which 10 questions carrying 15 marks in General Aptitude (GA) are compulsory.
</p>

<h3><b>NOTE:</b></h3><p> General Aptitude (GA-15 Marks) is common for all the engineering branch ( Civil-CE, Computer Science-CS, Information technology-IT, CE, Mech, EE, ECE, IN. Question of General Aptitude will remain same for branches held in same seating.
</p>
<h3><b>Engineering Mathematics</b></h3><p> will carry 15 % of the total marks, the General Aptitude section will carry 15 % of the total marks and the remaining 70 % of the total marks is technical in nature.</p>

<h3><b>Engineering Mathematics</b></h3><p> Syllabus for Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Communication Engineering & Instrumentation Engineering is same and same question would be asked in the examination of gate 2014.</p>
<h3><b>
Engineering Mathematics</b></h3><p> Syllabus for Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering & Mechanical Engineering is same and same question would be asked in the examination of gate 2014.</p>

<p>Few topics of engineering mathematics are common for Computer Science & IT Engineering, Electrical, Electronics & Communication , Civil, Instrumentation, Chemical and mechanical engineering.</p>

<h3><b>Marking scheme:</b></h3><p> Negative marking of 1/3rd for One marks question and Negative marking of 2/3rd for Two marks question.
</p>
<h3><b>
Unattempted question:</b></h3><p> No Marks
</p>
<h3><b>Linked answer question pair:</b></h3><p>  Each question carries 2 marks, 2/3 mark will be deducted for a wrong answer to the first question only. There is no negative marking for wrong answer to the second question of the linked answer question pair.</p><p>
 If the first question in the linked pair is wrongly answered or is unattempted, then the answer to the second question in the pair will not be evaluated. There is no negative marking for numerical answer type questions.</p>

<h3><b>Common DATA :</b></h3><p> Multiple choice type : Equal marks to all related questions.
</p>
<h3><b>General Aptitude (GA) Section:</b></h3><p> Same Question will be expected for Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Communication Engineering & Instrumentation engineering in the examination of gate 2014.</p>

<p>Same Question will be asked for Civil Engineering & Chemical Engineering in the examination of gate 2014.</p>
<p><b>
In all papers, GA questions are of multiple choice types, and carry a total of 15 marks. The GA section includes 5 questions carrying 1 mark each (sub-total 5 marks) and 5 questions carrying 2-marks each (sub-total 10 marks)
Question 1 to 25 : One mark each  ( Negative marking 1/3rd  )
Question 26 to 55 : Two  mark each   ( Negative marking 2/3rd  )
Question 56 to 65 : General Aptitude  ( total 15 marks )  : ( Negative marking 1/3rd  for One marks & 2/3rd  for Two  mark  )
Question 56 to 60  : One mark each          Question 61 to 65  : Two  mark each</b></p>
